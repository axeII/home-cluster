## üìñ  Overview

Here, I perform DevOps best practices but at home. Check out the hardware section where I describe what sort of hardware I am using. Thanks to Ansible, it's very easy for me to manage my home infrastructure and the cluster.  I try to adhere to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and GitOps practices using tools like [Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform), [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes), [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2), [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## ‚õµ Kubernetes

There is a template over at [onedr0p/cluster-template](https://github.com/onedr0p/cluster-template) if you wanted to try and follow along with some of the practices I use here.

### Installation

For my cluster, I decided to use the PostgreSQL database instead of high IO load using etcd. I store critical data for my cluster in the PostgreSQL database and maintain it in High Availability mode. I use k3s deployed on ubuntu machines. For that I use ansible to prepare the machines and then install k3s and deploy my cluster configuration.


### Core Components

- [calico](https://www.tigera.io/project-calico/) - CNI (container network interface)
- [echo-server](https://github.com/Ealenn/Echo-Server) - REST Server Tests (Echo-Server) API (useful for debugging HTTP issues)
- [longhorn](https://longhorn.com) - storage class provider for data persistence (yeah I'm giving longhorn second chance)
- [k8s_gateway](https://github.com/ori-edge/k8s_gateway) - DNS resolver for all types of external Kubernetes resources
- [flux](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/) - GitOps tool for deploying manifests from the `cluster` directory
- [metallb](https://metallb.universe.tf/) - bare metal load balancer
- [kube-vip](https://kube-vip.io) - layer 2 load balancer for the Kubernetes control plane
- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) - SSL certificates - with Cloudflare DNS challenge
- [traefik](https://traefik.io/): Provides ingress cluster services.
- [botkube](https://github.com/infracloudio/botkube) Bot that helps me to monitor the cluster with notifications.
- [hajimari](https://github.com/toboshii/hajimari) - start page with ingress discovery
- [reflector](https://github.com/emberstack/kubernetes-reflector) - mirror configmaps or secrets to other Kubernetes namespaces
- [reloader](https://github.com/stakater/Reloader) - restart pods when Kubernetes `configmap` or `secret` changes
- [system-upgrade-controller](https://github.com/rancher/system-upgrade-controller) - upgrade k3s
- [SOPS](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/guides/mozilla-sops/): Encrypts secrets which is safe to store - even to a public repository.
<!--- [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns): Creates DNS entries in a separate [coredns](https://github.com/coredns/coredns)-->


### ‚ò∏ GitOps

[Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches my [kubernetes](./kubernetes) folder (see Directories below) and makes the changes to my cluster based on the YAML manifests.

The way Flux works for me here is it will recursively search the [kubernetes/apps](./kubernetes/apps) folder until it finds the most top level `kustomization.yaml` per directory and then apply all the resources listed in it. That aforementioned `kustomization.yaml` will generally only have a namespace resource and one or many Flux kustomizations. Those Flux kustomizations will generally have a `HelmRelease` or other resources related to the application underneath it which will be applied.

[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) watches my **entire** repository looking for dependency updates, when they are found a PR is automatically created. When some PRs are merged [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) applies the changes to my cluster.

### Directories

This Git repository contains the following directories under [kubernetes](./kubernetes).

```sh
üìÅ kubernetes      # Kubernetes cluster defined as code
‚îú‚îÄüìÅ bootstrap     # Flux installation
‚îú‚îÄüìÅ flux          # Main Flux configuration of repository
‚îî‚îÄüìÅ apps          # Apps deployed into my cluster grouped by namespace (see below)
```


### :file_cabinet: Hardware

My homelab runs on the following hardware (all k8s nodes are running on ubuntu 20.04):

### üì∞ Blog post

Feel free to checkout my blog [axell.dev](https://axell.dev) which is also [open source](https://github.com/axeII/my-blog)!
I also have made a blog post about HW, what were my choices... which ones were good and which ones were bad. [Click here](https://axell.dev/favorite/my-home-lab/).


## ü§ù Gratitude and Thanks

I am proud to be a member of the home operations (previously k8s-at-home) community! I received a lot of help and inspiration for my Kubernetes cluster from this community which helped a lot. Thanks! :heart:


If you are interested in running your own k8s cluster at home, I highly recommend you to check out the [k8s-at-home](https://k8s-at-home.com) website.

Be sure to check out [kubesearch.dev](https://kubesearch.dev) for ideas on how to deploy applications or get ideas on what you may deploy.
